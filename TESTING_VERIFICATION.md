# Action System Testing Verification

## Compilation Status
✅ **Build Successful** - `npm run build` completed with no errors

## Code Verification

### 1. Action System Integration ✅

**Hook Usage:**
- `useActionSystem` properly imported in DmuxApp.tsx
- ActionSystem initialized with all required context (panes, savePanes, sessionName, projectName)
- `onPaneRemove` callback properly configured

**Action Components:**
- `ActionChoiceDialog` imported and rendered
- `ActionConfirmDialog` imported and rendered
- Both components receive proper props from actionState

### 2. VIEW Action Migration ✅

**Three triggers successfully migrated:**

1. **Kebab Menu (Option 0)**
   ```typescript
   actionSystem.executeAction(PaneAction.VIEW, currentPane);
   ```

2. **'j' Key**
   ```typescript
   actionSystem.executeAction(PaneAction.VIEW, panes[selectedIndex]);
   ```

3. **Enter Key**
   ```typescript
   actionSystem.executeAction(PaneAction.VIEW, panes[selectedIndex]);
   ```

### 3. CLOSE Action Migration ✅

**Two triggers successfully migrated:**

1. **Kebab Menu (Close option)**
   ```typescript
   actionSystem.executeAction(PaneAction.CLOSE, currentPane);
   ```

2. **'x' Key**
   ```typescript
   actionSystem.executeAction(PaneAction.CLOSE, panes[selectedIndex]);
   ```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Shows choice dialog with 3 options:
  - "Just close pane"
  - "Close and remove worktree" (danger)
  - "Close and delete everything" (danger)
- Arrow keys navigate options
- Enter selects option
- ESC cancels

### 4. MERGE Action Migration ✅

**Two triggers successfully migrated:**

1. **Kebab Menu (Merge option)**
   ```typescript
   actionSystem.executeAction(PaneAction.MERGE, currentPane, { mainBranch: getMainBranch() });
   ```

2. **'m' Key**
   ```typescript
   actionSystem.executeAction(PaneAction.MERGE, panes[selectedIndex], { mainBranch: getMainBranch() });
   ```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Checks for uncommitted changes
- Generates commit message: `feat: changes from {slug}`
- Stages all changes
- Commits
- Merges into main branch
- Shows confirm dialog: "Close pane after merge?"
- If yes: removes worktree and closes pane

### 5. Dialog Input Handling ✅

**Confirm Dialog:**
- 'y' or 'Y' → executes onConfirmYes callback
- 'n' or 'N' → executes onConfirmNo callback
- ESC → executes onConfirmNo callback
- Prevents event bubbling with early return

**Choice Dialog:**
- Up Arrow → decrements selected index (wraps to bottom)
- Down Arrow → increments selected index (wraps to top)
- Enter → executes onChoiceSelect with selected option ID
- ESC → closes dialog
- Prevents event bubbling with early return

### 6. API Routes ✅

All 6 action system endpoints compiled and wired up:

1. `GET /api/actions` - List all available actions
2. `GET /api/panes/:id/actions` - Get actions for specific pane
3. `POST /api/panes/:paneId/actions/:actionId` - Execute action
4. `POST /api/callbacks/confirm/:callbackId` - Respond to confirm dialog
5. `POST /api/callbacks/choice/:callbackId` - Respond to choice dialog
6. `POST /api/callbacks/input/:callbackId` - Respond to input dialog

**Route Implementation:**
- Uses h3 `eventHandler` wrapper
- Promise-based adapter for Node.js handlers
- Proper HTTP method checking
- JSON response handling

## Known Limitations

1. **Interactive Testing Not Performed**
   - Cannot run dmux interactively from Claude Code's pane (no raw stdin)
   - Would require separate tmux session or manual testing
   - Code compilation and structure verified instead

2. **Old Code Still Present**
   - `useWorktreeActions` hook still exists (marked with TODO)
   - Old dialog components (MergePane, CloseOptionsDialog) still present
   - Should be removed after manual testing confirms everything works

## Next Steps for Manual Testing

Once dmux is run in a proper tmux session, test:

1. **VIEW Action**
   - [ ] Press 'k' to open kebab menu, select "View" → should jump to pane
   - [ ] Press 'j' on a pane → should jump to pane
   - [ ] Press Enter on a pane → should jump to pane

2. **CLOSE Action**
   - [ ] Press 'k', select "Close" → should show 3 options
   - [ ] Use arrow keys to navigate options
   - [ ] Select "Just close pane" → closes pane, keeps worktree
   - [ ] Select "Close and remove worktree" → removes worktree
   - [ ] Select "Close and delete everything" → deletes everything

3. **MERGE Action**
   - [ ] Press 'k', select "Merge" on pane with worktree → shows confirm
   - [ ] Confirm merge → commits, merges, asks to close pane
   - [ ] Test with uncommitted changes → should auto-commit
   - [ ] Test with clean worktree → should merge successfully

4. **API Endpoints**
   ```bash
   # Test endpoints with curl
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/actions
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/panes/<pane-id>/actions
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/panes/<pane-id>/actions/close
   ```

## Conclusion

✅ **All code changes successfully compiled and integrated**
✅ **Action system architecture is complete**
✅ **Migration is functionally complete for VIEW, CLOSE, MERGE actions**
⏳ **Manual interactive testing pending**
⏳ **Old code cleanup pending after testing confirmation**
