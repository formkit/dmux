⚠️ **This is a placeholder package** ⚠️

The actual dmux package is currently in development.

## What is dmux?

- **Project-specific tmux sessions**: Each project gets its own isolated tmux session
- **Git worktree integration**: Each pane operates in its own git worktree with a dedicated branch
- **AI agent automation**: Automatically launches AI agents with prompts
